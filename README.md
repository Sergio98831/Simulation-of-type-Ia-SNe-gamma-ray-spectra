# Simulation-of-type-Ia-SNe-gamma-ray-spectra
Simulation of theoretical type Ia Gamma-ray spectra as they would be observed with ASTENA Narrow-Field Telescope. In this work I selcted the most sophisticated theoretical simulations of Type Ia SNe spectra and I investigate how the proposed mission ASTENA Narrow-Field Telescope would observe them.
